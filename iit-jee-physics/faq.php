</li>
	<li>Q. Is this book sufficient for IIT JEE preparation?<br />
	A. No. This book is to supplement your Physics text book like Concepts of Physics by Dr HC Verma.</li>
	<li>Q. How this book is better than similar books available in the market?<br />
	A. No comment. We made efforts to come up with an excellent product. The comparative studies are left to the readers.</li>
	<li>Q. Is this book relevant for Medical Entrance Examinations?<br />
	A. Yes. Prime objective of the book is to give insight into the concepts of physics through IIT JEE problems. The format of the questions/examinations is not important.</li>
	<li>Q. What about next edition of the book?<br />
	A. Our plan is to release new edition every year to keep the book updated with JEE examination. We expect new edition to be released within 2-3 months of JEE Advanced.</li>
	<li>Q. Why JEE (Mains) questions are not included in this book?<br />
	A. IIT JEE (Mains) examination is conducted by CBSE. We observed that JEE (Mains) questions will not add much value to this book. We will provide the  JEE (Mains) questions and solutions on this website.</li>
	<li>Q. What about price of the book?<br />
	A. We set a MRP of Rs 495/- for each volume. The price is neither too high nor too low. Our intention is to provide good quality product at a reasonable price.</li>  
	<li>Q. Why solutions are not provided immediately after the question?<br />
	A. The book is more readable if a question is followed by its solution. This suggestion came to us from many individuals. But we went against the norm even if it cause in-convenience to our readers. We strongly believe that IIT JEE questions are to be worked out by the readers and not to be just read about. If the solution follows a question then the readers are tempted to read the solution before attempting it himself/herself. The solutions are provided in separate section to avoid this temptation.</li>  
	<li>Q. Why solutions are provided in the book?<br />
	A. We wish that readers work out the solution themselves and  see our solution only to cross-check. This is a better way of learning. We provided solutions to make this book as a material for self-study. There are a large number of students who perceive IIT JEE question as difficult. This false perception developed because these students are not properly trained by teachers. The solutions are provided to break this psychological barrier. 
</li>
	<li>Q. Why IIT JEE questions are arranged according to chapters in "Concepts of Physics" and not according to other books like NCERT, Resnick and Halliday etc?<br />
	A. The "Concepts of Physics" is one of the classic book available in the market. The market also have other "good" books and a plethora of "not so good" books. Unfortunately, many students end up buying "not so good" books due to aggressive marketing strategies by their supplier. One of the allegation made against "Concepts of Physics" is that it does not have IIT JEE questions. Our book is an answer to this.</li>
	<li>Q. Is this book available in E-Book format?<br />
	A. No. We believe that Printed Books are best fiends of serious IIT JEE aspirants.</li>
	<li>Q. Why 6in by 9in size is selected for this book?<br />
	A. School text books generally comes in large size (typically A4 paper) with two column format. We selected a size which is more handy. Visualize the study scene of IIT JEE aspirant solving Physics problem. His/her table generally have a note-book to write and a "large" text-book to read. We selected a smaller size because this is the third book to be accommodated on the same table. </li>
	<li>Q. The questions in each chapter are numbered from 1 to N, where N is number of questions in that chapter. Why they are not numbered section-wise? <br />
	A. This scheme is more convenient for the readers. The reader can refer to the answer/solution to a question by a single reference i.e., question number. He/she don't have to remember two reference (1) section number or name and (2) question number in that section. Wherever possible, we tried to incorporate ideas that makes the book better (even if it is an small change like this). In the words of Donald Knuth, "Don't believe that popular things are the best."  </li>
	<li>Q. Why figures are not numbered in the book?<br />
	A. The figures are not numbered because it is not required in this book. This decision is against the popular choice. Generally, figures are numbered because they are floating objects i.e., the figure and 'text related to the figure' may not be at the same place/page. The reader has to refer to a figure while reading the text. This is not the case in this book. The figures are always placed next to the questions/solutions. Giving figures number in this scenario is redundant information. </li>
	<li>Q. Which Physics book shall I buy for IIT JEE preparation?<br />
	A. We are biased towards "Concepts of Physics" by Dr HC Verma. To be fair, NCERT and Resnick and Halliday are equally good. In our opinion, study from only one book (although you may buy many). Most of these "good" books have similar type of contents, so reading them all will just be a waste of time.</li>
	<li>Q. What about solving "Problems in General Physics" by I.E. Irodov?<br />
	A. We agree with opinion of <a href="http://www.nitinjain.info/tips/iitjee-tips-physics">Nitin Jain</a> IIT JEE Topper "If you love physics, you can try solving books like I.E. Irodov as the questions in such books expand your understanding of physics. Note that most of the questions in such books are outside the syllabus and level of IIT JEE exam, and thus you don't need to do them. But if you have solved a book for IIT JEE Physics, try to solve Irodov. It might be fun and will definitely enrich your knowledge of physics."
	</li>
	<li>Q. Why your book contains questions from IIT JEE only? There are better questions available in other books?<br />
	A. IIT JEE questions are formulated by some of the best minds. Every year, IIT professors comes up with 30 to 40 new questions to test understanding of the JEE aspirants. These questions are valuable resource to unravel a deeper understanding of the physical concepts. There may be better questions elsewhere, but IIT JEE questions are most relevant for JEE aspirants.</li>
