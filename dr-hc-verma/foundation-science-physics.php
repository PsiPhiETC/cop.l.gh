Given below are the buyers' comment taken from Flipkart: 

<p> <q>I had read this book in my school days. It was my passion to read many books of different authors. But ultimately this was the book which gave me complete satisfaction. What to talk about Dr. H.C Verma, he is so well known for his Concepts of Physics. This book not only presents a concept in an outstanding manner but it also creates a scientific temperament to think upon yourself. It is this book which has made my fundamentals so strong that helped me in my further higher education also.
