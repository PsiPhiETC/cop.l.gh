<h1>Utsahi Physics Teachers Group</h1>
<i>...most of the information given below is taken from <a href="http://www.utsahiphysicsteachers.com/default.htm" target="_blank">Utsahi Physics Teachers</a> website.</i> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This group has been coordinated by Professor H. C. Verma. He is constantly interacting with Physics teachers at school and college levels towards making Physics Teaching interesting and more meaningful. From these interactions, this group of highly motivated teachers has evolved which we call “Utsahi Physics Teachers”.
</p>
<p>Through workshops on Physics experiments, Science shows, Teacher's training Camps and numerous other activities, <i>Utashi Physics Teachers</i> are spreading the fragrance of Physics learning thrill among students and teachers from middle school to undergraduate level.
</p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
Some of the activities carried out by Utsahi Physics Teachers Group are:
<ol>
	<li> <i>Introductory Interaction Programs (IIP)</i>: To give the first introduction of the Physics teaching methods using simple Physics experiments developed by this group, we conduct 7-hours workshops with a group of Physics teachers. More details on IIP and the procedure to conduct IIP at your institution is given at <a href="http://www.utsahiphysicsteachers.com/iip/default.htm" target="_blank">Utsahi Physics Teachers</a> website. </li>
	<li> <i>National Workshop for Utsahi Physics Teachers (NWUPT)</i>: The Senior Resource Persons including Prof. H. C. Verma keep doing short term workshops (e.g. IIP) with Physics Teachers round the year. We encourage these teachers to implement new innovative teaching methodologies in their teaching programmes and write to us about their experiences. During these interactions, a number of enthusiastic teachers are identified who have potential and will contribute towards innovations in Physics Teaching. Only such teachers are invited in the 6-day NWUPT held every year in Summers, generally at IIT Kanpur. See <a href="http://www.utsahiphysicsteachers.com/nationalworkshops/default.htm" target="_blank">NWUPT</a> page for more details. Click <a href="http://www.utsahiphysicsteachers.com/reports/annualReports.htm" target="_blank">NWUPT Reports</a> to see reports of previous workshops. </li>    
	<li> <i>Anveshika and National Anveshika Network of India (NANI)</i>: Many of the Utsahi Physics Teachers are Anveshika Coordinators. These Anveshika's work together under the framework of National Anveshika Network of India (NANI) being coordinated by Dr HC Verma.
