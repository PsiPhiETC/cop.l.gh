<h1>About Anveshika</h1>
<p>
Anveshika is an Indian Association of Physics Teachers (IAPT) initiative to create centers across India where student and teachers can learn experiment-based physics and try out their own ideas. Anveshika centres are established at different places within the country under National Anveshika Network of India (NANI) initiative. Anveshika is essentially an open ended laboratory where uncommon experiments are set up without constraints of any board syllabus or examination. New experiments are continuously evolved as and when any idea strikes the students or the teachers.
