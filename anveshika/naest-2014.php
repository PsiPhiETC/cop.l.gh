<h2>SCREENING Test Venue and Timing</h2>
<p>
The NEST Screening Test will be held from 2:00PM to 5:00PM on 2nd Aug 2014(Sat) at ECE Auditorium, University College of Engineering, Osmania University, Hyderabad. 
</p>
<p>
The test will be semi-interactive in nature. The students will be shown a live demo/video clip of an experiment/concept and question will be asked on that. The student need to write the answer in answer sheet provided by organizer (students are requested to bring examination pad and pen). There will be 10-12 demo/video clip like this. The students will be given sufficient time to think, analyse and write after each demo/video. The test is meant to check students understanding and conceptual clarity. We do not recommend any type of preparation for the NEST as it is meant to check natural abilities/skills of the student.

The test will be in both English and Telugu. We will try our best to provide friendly and encouraging environment so that student can deliver his/her best.
