   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-60001"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">Everyone has a basic understanding of the concept of force from everyday experience. Physics students know it well
that the SI unit of force is Newton (N) and is defined as a force which can produce an acceleration of <span class="cmr-10">1</span> <span class="cmr-10">m</span><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;</span><span class="cmr-10">s</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup> in a
<span class="cmr-10">1</span> <span class="cmr-10">kg</span> mass. But usually students have no idea about how hard a push or pull is <span class="cmr-10">1 N</span>. This simple demo experiment
gives them a physical feel of how much <span class="cmr-10">1 N</span> is.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-70001"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Take a weighing machine where the object is placed on the platform and the mass in displayed on a dial or on a
digital display. See the reading, if it has any zero error, remove it. Usually a screw is provided on the machine to
adjust zero. Now if you push the pan by a force of <span class="cmr-10">1 N</span>, the reading will be close to <span class="cmr-10">100 gram</span> (taking <span class="cmmi-10">g </span><span class="cmr-10">=</span> <span class="cmr-10">10</span> <span class="cmr-10">m</span><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;</span><span class="cmr-10">s</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>).
So, ask the student to press the pan of the weighing machine by a force which he/she thinks is <span class="cmr-10">1 N</span>. To dramatize,
ask the student not to see the reading and push the pan. Some other student should read the reading and tell how
many Newton of force the first student has applied. The conversion is simple; <span class="cmr-10">100 gram</span> of reading means
<span class="cmr-10">1 N</span>. My experience with hundreds of students is that they apply between <span class="cmr-10">6</span>-<span class="cmr-10">9 N</span> and think that to be
<span class="cmr-10">1 N</span>.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   Finally let the students see the reading and adjust the push till the dial reading shows 100 g weight.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-80001"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent">To measure something is part of science training. Physical laws are relations between the measured quantities. We
measure lengths using scales, time using clocks, and mass using balances. Here a balance is used to measure force
and hence it becomes a simple “force meter”.

<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent">Check Newton’s law for interaction between two ring magnets.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-140002"></a>Equipment</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">Weighing machine, two ring magnets, PVC stand.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-150002"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Newton’s Laws are taught from class 9 to 12 in schools. A lot of Physics including whole of mechanics is built on it.
Among the three laws of motion given by Newton, the 3rd law is always confusing and creates a lot of problem in
making clear mental picture.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   A common statement for Newton’s 3rd law reads as “for every action there is always an equal and opposite
reaction”. The important part which is generally missed out that it concerns the forces exerted by
two bodies on each other. This demo shows that forces exerted by two ring magnets are equal and
opposite.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-160002"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">PVC stand is just a pipe fixed on some base with fevicol or any other adhesive. Ring magnets are those
used in audio speakers. Weigh the two ring magnets, say A and B, and the stand separately. Let the
weights be <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub>, <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> and <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">3</span></sub>. Put the first ring magnet A in the stand and place this stand on weighing
machine pan, display of the weighing machine will show <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">3</span></sub> <span class="cmr-10">+ </span><span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub>. After this put the other magnet B in
the same stand in such a way that it will be in the repulsive mode with magnet A. The magnet B
will be floating in the air having no vertical contact force with anything. Still the dial reading will
be <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> <span class="cmr-10">+ </span><span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> <span class="cmr-10">+ </span><span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">3</span></sub>. Although the magnet B is floating in air i.e.&nbsp;it is not on weighing pan and is
stationary in air (i.e.&nbsp;net vertical force acting on B is zero), but the scale reading has increased by
<span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>. That means B is pushing A downwards by the force <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>. Now, B is not falling so some force
acts on it upwards to hold it there. This force is from magnet A only. So, magnet A is pushing B by
a force <span class="cmmi-10">W</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> upwards. Thus the two forces exerted by the two magnets on each other are equal and
opposite.

   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-170002"></a>When to use</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">At present Newton’s third law is very poorly understood by most of our students even when they pass out class 12.
The subject is introduced in class 9 where this demo may be given. You can do it in class 11 too where lot of
mechanics is taught.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">To discuss misconcepts about inertia.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-220003"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Newton’s three law of motion are taught in school from quite early times. Though students know
the statements of the three laws but when it comes to application, quite often the laws are wrongly
interpreted. The experiment described is quite common and is shown to dramatize the concept of
Newton’s 1st law of motion or inertia. However, a detailed analysis reveals greater insight into the
laws.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-230003"></a>Required Materials</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">A glass tumbler, a long piece ofpaper, a table.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-240003"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">Near the edge of a table, place a glass tumbler filled with water. Now hold the part of the paper overhanging from
the table using both hands. Give a sharp jerk to the paper and pull it quickly. What you find is that the paper
comes out from below the glass and the glass just stays on the table with no water spilling out. Try pulling the
paper with different speeds and see what happens.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-250003"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">The common explanation is that because of inertia, the glass remains at its place and the paper comes. But is it the
explanation? Where does this inertia go, when the paper is pulled slowly? Does inertia depend on velocity? It is
friction, acceleration and distance moved under this acceleration that have to be roped in for proper
understanding.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-260003"></a>Hazard</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">If you are using glass tumber and dont pull it quickly it may fall. Use steel glass to practice.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">An effect of <span class="cmmi-10">g </span>is the extension in a slinky. As you must have experienced, a slinky is like a spring but the turns are
very flexible and even without a load, it can extend to several times of its natural length under its own weight. If
you hold few turns of a slinky in your hand and let the rest of it hang from there, the hanging part also extends
through large distances. This extension again is because of <span class="cmmi-10">g</span>. If the effect of <span class="cmmi-10">g </span>can be reduced to zero, the slinky in a
vertical position will not extend.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-320004"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">Hold some of the turns of a slinky in one hand holding some of the turns in one hand Not clear. Let
rest of it hang vertically. The hanging part will be extended. By holding appropriate number of turns
make this part about <span class="cmr-10">10 cm</span>. Now leave the slinky and let it fall. You may catch the falling slinky
at some lower level. The extended turns all shrink. You may do it several times to show the effect
clearly.
<!--l. 8--></p><p class="indent">   The slinky shrinks because in the frame of the falling slinky, there is no effect of gravity. The slinky has become
weightless as all measurable effects of weight have vanished.

there is a large visible extension when you hang a load. Dropping it will shrink the spring.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-380005"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">We all are very familiar with iron nails. However, in this experiment we shall use them not to strike them inside
the walls but to surprise the audience. Let us see how on a single nail an entire set of nails can be
balanced.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-390005"></a>Required material</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">15 equal-sized nails, each about 2-3 inches long.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-400005"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40002x1">Fix a nail on a piece of wood or some lid so that it remains vertical with its flat top up. We will call
     this arrangement stand.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40004x2">Now, ask your friends to balance the remaining nails on the nail fixed to the stand. Your friends will
     be a real fix attempting to put so many nails in a very small space. But, you come to their rescue by
     demonstrating how this can be done.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40006x3">Place a nail on a table so that its head it towards you. We may call it base nail.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40008x4">Now, arrange the remaining 12 nail, over the base nail on the left and right of it in such a manner that
     the heads of all the nails are towards the base nail. Place the head of the right nail on the base nail
     then the head of the left nail on the base nail, again the head of the right nail, then the head of the
     left nail, and so on, till you have placed all the 12 nails on the base nail.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40010x5">Now, place the fourteenth nail on the base nail in such a manner that its sharp end is towards the head
     of the base nail. In this way all the twelve nail will come between the base nail and the upper nail.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-40012x6">Pressing both the base nail and the upper nail against each other and holding them with both you hand
     carefully place the entire set of nails at the mid print of the base nail fixed to the stand. Withdraw
     both your hands slowly. The pointed or sharp ends of the nails get lowered on both the left and right
     sides and their blunt and flat ends get entangled with one another. The entire set of nail resting on the
     base nail balances on the nail stuck to the stand. Surprising, isn’t it?</li></ol>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-410005"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">In this experiment the principle of centre of gravity plays its role. According to this principle, due
to the weight of the inclined nails on both sides of the base nail the weight of the entire set-up acts
below the balancing point. Thus, the entire set of nails balances comfortably. You may gently lower the
nails on one side and then remove your hand. This makes the entire set-up quiver but it does not fall
down.
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-420005"></a>Do and think a bit more</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">If you so desire, you may carefully remove some of the nails from both sides of the balancing point one by one. See
how many nails you can remove without disturbing the equilibrium state.

   <h2 class="chapterHead"><span class="titlemark">Experiment&nbsp;6</span><br><a id="x1-440006"></a>Why Does it Goes Up?</h2>
   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-450006"></a>Objective</h3>
<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent">Things move in the direction in which the potential energy decreases.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-460006"></a>Equipment</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">Two cycle-spokes, two plastic funnels, adhesives like fevicol or fevi-quick.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-470006"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">Bodies put on an inclined plane come down the plane. If it can roll it rolls down. This can be understood in terms of
potential energy. By coming down, the gravitational potential energy decreases. A system under given conservative
forces moves in such a way that the potential energy decreases. This demonstration emphasizes this principle in a
dramatic way as in the first look; the object seems to go up on an inclined plane. A careful analysis reveals that
indeed it is decreasing its potential energy.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-480006"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Join two plastic funnels at the rim with the help of an adhesive. You can even use Cello-tape to join them. This
makes a double-cone. Arrange to make a rail by two spokes in such a way that the height of the rail as well as the
separation between the spokes gradually increases. You can take two pieces of thermocol and push the spokes
properly in them to make the structure. The plane of the spokes becomes an inclined plane. You will
have to adjust the geometry by trial for the demo to work. The height of the rail increases from A to
B.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   Place a cylindrical object like a pencil near the top of the rail and see that it comes down as expected. Now place
the double cone near the top and it wont come down. Place it near the bottom. It goes up and settles near the top of
the rail. Students will enjoy the scene.
<!--l. 9--></p><p class="indent">   Guide them to the Physics of it. Because of the geometry, as the double cone goes from A to B, supposedly up
the rail, more and more portion of the middle bulge goes between the spokes and the cone actually dips. You can
measure the height of the straight tube part of the funnel above the table when the double- cone is near the bottom
of the rail and when it is near the top of the rail. It is less in the later case showing that the double cone is actually
going down while it seems to go up.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-490006"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent">Encourage students to make their own equipment. The double-cone made by funnels has a particularly simple and
effective geometry. But they can even do it with spherical balls. The only skill is in making a proper angle between
the two spokes so that the object dips as it goes ahead on it.
<!--l. 12--></p><p class="indent">   You can also discuss motion of extended bodies using this apparatus. Different parts of the double cone will move
along different paths. Some portions of the cone will come up and some will go down. Gravitational potential energy
of some portions will therefore increase and of others will decrease. The overall potential energy of the system is
decided by the motion of the Center of Mass. If the height of the center of mass above a horizontal surface increases,
the potential energy increases too. Similarly, if the height of the center of mass decreases, the potential energy also
decreases. Ask the students to mentally locate and follow the motion of the center of mass as the cone goes up.
Indeed these intensive discussions are to be made outside the class where students do the experiments and
observe.

<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">As an interesting demo it can be shown to anyone, even children of age 5 will enjoy. However for Physics teaching
you can use it when talking about the potential energy and the fact that system moves in a direction to decrease its
potential energy. Most likely this is at class 11.

<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Negligible cost. Available easily in any market. In place of cycle spokes, you can use the rods (called SALAI in
Hindi) on which ladies knit sweaters.

   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-580007"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">You can discuss this phenomenon of the hanging mass going up in a number of ways. The tension in the string,
which provides the centripetal force, should be <span class="cmmi-10">mv</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;r</span>. But this tension should also be <span class="cmmi-10">Mg</span>, the weight of the
hanging body if it keeps in equilibrium. Thus <span class="cmmi-10">mv</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;r </span><span class="cmr-10">= </span><span class="cmmi-10">Mg</span>. Now when you increase the speed of the rotating mass
<span class="cmmi-10">m </span>by adjusting the force from your hand, the tension <span class="cmmi-10">mv</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;r </span>is increased and hence the mass <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>moves up with
acceleration.
<!--l. 14--></p><p class="indent">   The explanation given above is simplistic. As you rotate your hand in a small path, the center of the so called
circular path of mass <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>also moves. The path is therefore not strictly circular.
<!--l. 16--></p><p class="indent">   Another deviation from the above description comes due to the friction between the string and the plastic body
at the upper edge. This will make the tensions in two parts of the string different.
<!--l. 18--></p><p class="indent">   But still the difference being small the qualitative explanation is OK. The fact that the simplistic explanation is
not heavily in error you can calculate the value of <span class="cmmi-10">g </span>from the equation <span class="cmmi-10">mv</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;r </span><span class="cmr-10">= </span><span class="cmmi-10">Mg </span>when you adjust your hand
force to keep the hanging mass <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>at a fixed height. This comes out to be quite close to the actual value
<span class="cmr-10">9</span><span class="cmmi-10">.</span><span class="cmr-10">8</span> <span class="cmr-10">m</span><span class="cmmi-10">&#8725;</span><span class="cmr-10">s</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup>.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">It is the same set up that I described in experiment&nbsp;<a href="http://concepts-of-physics.com/images/Anveshika/resources/anveshika-experiments.html#x1-530007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: expt:lift-a-weight --></a>. If a particle of mass <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>is moving with an angular speed <span class="cmmi-10">&#969; </span>in
a circular path of radius <span class="cmmi-10">r</span>, its angular momentum about the axis of rotation is <span class="cmmi-10">m&#969;</span><sup><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sup><span class="cmmi-10">r</span>. If the radius <span class="cmmi-10">r </span>is decreased in
such a way that there is no torque about the axis of rotation, the angular speed <span class="cmmi-10">&#969; </span>will increase to conserve the
angular momentum. This demo shows this in a very clear manner.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-660008"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Start in the same manner as in the experiment&nbsp;<a href="http://concepts-of-physics.com/images/Anveshika/resources/anveshika-experiments.html#x1-530007">7<!--tex4ht:ref: expt:lift-a-weight --></a>. Pass a thread through the both side open plastic body of a used
pen. Tie two unequal masses <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>and <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>on the two sides of the string. Hold the plastic body in vertical position in
your hand with the heavier mass <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>hanging and the lighter mass <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>resting at the top of the plastic body. Give
motion to the masses by rotating your hand little bit. Speed up the rotating lighter mass so that the heavier hanging
mass moves right up to the plastic body.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   Stop the motion of your hand holding the plastic body. The mass <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>is rotating in a large circle. Using the other
hand pull the mass <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>down. This will decrease the radius of the path of the rotating mass. As the mass <span class="cmmi-10">M </span>is pulled
the angular speed of <span class="cmmi-10">m </span>increases and this can be very clearly observed. You can do it several times and explain the
conservation of angular momentum.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-710009"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">You might have heard about a sprinkler and also seen water being sprinkled with its help in all directions in the
gardens. Usually, a sprinkler is used for irrigation purposes in agriculture or in gardens. Using it a large area of the
land can be irrigated at a time. Depending on the requirement different kinds of sprinkler are available in the
market. Here, we will make a sprinkler using a plastic bottle and discuss its science. While sprinkling water the
bottle also dances which adds to the joy of this experiment.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-720009"></a>Required material</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Two plastic bottles of square cross-section, thread.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-730009"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-73002x1">Place a bottle of square cross-section in front of you. It has four large surfaces. Make a hole on the
     right lower side of any of these surfaces. To make the hole you may use the spoke of a bicycle, heat it
     on a candle flame and then insert it into the plastic. The job of making the hole should preferably be
     done in the presence of some elder persons. Make similar holes in this manner on the right lower sides
     of all the four surfaces.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-73004x2">Unscrew the cap of the bottle and tie a thread near its mouth in say a manner that on hanging the
     bottle by holding the thread it hangs vertically.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-73006x3">With the help of the thread hold the bottle at a height of about 1metre above a plastic tub.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-73008x4">Ask your friend to fill water in the bottle using a mug.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-73010x5">Water starts flowing out of the bottle and the bottle also starts rotating.</li></ol>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-740009"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Water streaming our of the holes is understandable but why was the bottle start dancing, after all? Actually, the
water while flowing out of the bottle exerts a pressure on it in the backward direction. This is in accordance with
Newton’s third law. Water contained in the bottle pushes the water out near the hole which makes water come out
of the hole. As reaction of this, the outflowing water pushes the water in the bottle backward. As the hole has been
male at the corner, the force being exerted on this part of the bottle will try to rotate it. The forces
acting on the four faces will rotate the bottle in the same direction and so the bottle starts dancing.
The water flowing out of the dancing bottle spreads in all the directions and presents the scene of a
sprinkler.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-750009"></a>Do and think A little more</h3>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">What will happen if on a bottle of square cross-section, holes one made on the right lower sides of two of its surfaces
while holes are made on the left lower side of its remaining two surfaces? Will the bottle rotate? If not why? Think,
Try the same experiment with a bottle of hexagonal cross-section having six faces. Is the speed of rotation of the
bottle affected? Take another bottle of square cross-section and make holes on left lower sides of its surfaces. Hang
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
this bottle by tying thread on it and fill in with water. What is the difference between dancing of this and the first
bottle?

we will perform a single experience to experience it.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-7900010"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-79002x1">Take a medium sized plastic bottle.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-79004x2">Make a large number of small holes at the bottom of the bottle.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-79006x3">You may make these holes with the help of a needle or safety pin.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-79008x4">Make a small hole also at the upper part of the bottle below its mouth i.e. on its neck.

     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-79014x7">Fill the bottle with water and close its lid. The level of water in the bottle must remain below the hole
     made on its neck.</li></ol>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8000010"></a>What will happen?</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">Certainly, the water will start flowing out through the holes made at the bottom of the bottle. If you so desire, you
may even stop the water flowing out from the bottom. Think how this can be done?
<!--l. 17--></p><p class="indent">   Just put your finger on the hole which you made on the neck of the bottle, and the water will shop flowing out
Therefore, when you want the water to flow out just remove your finger from the hole and when you
want to stop the water flow, simply block the hole with your finger. In this way, making use of only a
plastic bottle we are able to make an obedient device using which we can understand the effect of air
pressure.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8100010"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 19--><p class="noindent">Let us try to understand how this happens. When the holes made at the bottom of the bottle as well as the hole on
its neck are open, in that case due to the weight of the water column the total pressure on the bottom of the bottle
is more that the pressure of the air outside the bottle. As a result, the water flows out from the holes at the bottom
of the bottle. The air outside the bottle exert its influence so that water does not flow out while the pressure of
water inside the bottle tries to force the water out of the bottle. The hole near the neck. of the bottle being open,
the pressure of the air near the neck of the bottle is equal to the atmospheric pressure. This adding to the
pressure of water makes the total pressure inside the bottle greater than the atmospheric pressure. As a
result, the water flows out of the holes. Now, if you block the hole on the neck of the bottle with your
finger, you will see that the water stops flowing out. Does the water stop flowing as soon as you put
your finger on the hole? If you carefully observe you will find that the water stops flowing out within
just a few moments and not immediately. It happened so because when you close the hole on the
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
bottle’s neck, the space above the water column get cut off from the atmospheric air. Consequently, as
little water flows out from the holes, the volume of the air locked inside the bottle above the water
column increases and due to this increased volumes the pressure of the locked air decreases. Now, the
combined pressure of the locked air above the water column and the water column are not able to
exceed the atmospheric pressure being executed on the holes. And therefore, the water stops flowing
out.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8200010"></a>Do and think A little more</h3>
<!--l. 21--><p class="noindent">Make two instead of one hole on the neck of the bottle. What happens? Repeat the experiment by keeping the lid of
the bottle open. It is necessary to make a large number of holes at the bottom? Will only a single hole not
do?

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">We see many things happening in the kitchen. For instance, floating of oil on water and mixing of same type of
liquids with one another. Adding a little milk to water it whitens it by getting mixed with the whole of water.
Similarly, adding a few drops of ink on a glass filled with water makes the entire water acquire the colour of the ink.
But, is it possible that a few drops of ink make only the upper portion of the water coloured? In this experiment we
are going to do something of this sort.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8600011"></a>Required material</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">A drinking glass, red (or some other) colour, coffee heater ( a device used for heating water).
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8700011"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-87002x1">Fill a drinking glass little more than half with water.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-87004x2">Immense the coffee heater in the glass in such a manner that only some of the upper portion of water

     is not disturbed.</li></ol>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">After some time, watch if the entire water or only other upper portion of it acquires the red colour? You will sea that
only the upper portion of water becomes red while the lower portion of water remains colourless. i.e. the upper
portion of water in the glass floats above its lower portion.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8800011"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">When we throw a piece of wood into water it floats on it. But, when we drop a steel spoon into water it sinks. It is
for the simple reason that the density of wood is less than that of water while the density of steel is greater as
compared to water. An object of lower density floats on an object of greater density. The oil because of its low
density as compared to water floats on it. In our experiment, the upper portion of the water was heated. Its density,
therefore, decreased while the density of the lower portion of water, which did not receive heat, remained the same.
So, the upper portion of water kept floating on the lower portion and did not get mixed up with it. As the red colour
had first spread over the upper portion of water, it remained there and did not spread to the lower
portion.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-8900011"></a>Do and think A little more</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">What will happen when water of the upper portion becomes cold? Will you in that case also observe coloured water
in the upper portion and clear water on the lower portion? If we add some colour on a glass filled with cold water,
will only the upper portion of water be coloured? Think, if densities of both the liquids are same they should
remains where they are and should not get mixed up with each other. However, this does not happen and the two
liquids get mixed up making the entire water coloured. This is due to the BROWNIAN motion of the molecular of
liquids.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">These days we find suitcases, cooler stands etc., being fitted with wheels. Have you ever thought what is the reason
behind fitting of these wheels ? This is because rolling down an object on a surface is easier than dragging or
pushing it. You may clearly have an experience of it in the present experiment.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-9300012"></a>Required Materials</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Two cylindrical pencils, pens or thick ball pen refills, a book with a heavy cardboard cover on it.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-9400012"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-94002x1">Keep the heavy book on the top of the table.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-94004x2">Keep your palm on its upper surface and by applying force with your palm in the forward direction
     try to move the book on the table, what have you experienced? To push the book on the table some
     force is needed. The heavier the book more will be the force required moving it.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-94006x3">Now, keep two pencils on the table parallel to each other and a little distance apart. Keep the book
     gently on these pencils. One of the pencils must be almost in the middle of the book while the other
     one must be near to one of the covers of the book.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-94008x4">Now, placing your palm on the book, again try to move it on the table. What have you experienced in
     this case? This time the book is able to move very easily on the table i.e. very little force is required
     as compared to the previous case.</li></ol>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-9500012"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">What is the main difference between the first and the second case? In the first case, a bigger area of the book was in
contact with a larger portion of the table. On moving the book on the table both the surfaces rubbed against each
other and the book then moved on the table. In this case the frication between the book and the table is very large.
As a result, we have to apply a very large force. But, when we kept the book on the pencils and tried to move it,
only a small portion of the book was in control with the pencils. When the book moved the pencils rolled down.
This means that the surfaces of the pencils and the book were not rubbing against each other. In
the same way, only a small surface of the pencils was in contact with the table and when the pencils
moved forward they kept on rolling as well. Here also the surface of the pencils did not rub against the
surface of the table. The frictions between the surfaces while rolling is much less than the friction during
pushing/ dragging. Therefore, we have to apply very little force and the book moves forward during
rolling.

<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent">Think, while you are walking on the ground what kind of friction acts between your feet/ shoes and the ground?
What is the kind of friction between the moving wheel of a bicycle and the ground? Why do the hands get warmed
when rubbed against each other?

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-9900013"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">We have read in books about cohesive and adhesive forces. When two objects made of the same material are in
contact with each other, the force acting between the molecules of the surfaces in contract is called
cohesive force. However, when two objects of different materials remain in contact, the force between
molecules of the surfaces in contact is called adhesive force. How strong are these forces? Sometimes
they are so strong that they may appear to challenge even persons of great physical strength. In this
experiment we shall use a drop of water to make two thin slides stick to each other, and study these
forces.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10000013"></a>Required Materials</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Two thin glass plates (Slides), water.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10100013"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-101002x1">In biology labs or diagnostic shops meant for blood test, thin rectangular glass plates are used. These
     plates are called slides. Take two such slides.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-101004x2">Place a drop of water on any of the slides.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-101006x3">Keep the second slide on the first Moving the slides over each other, spread the water drop between
     them.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-101008x4">Now by putting the slides with your hands try to separate them out from each other. Remember you
     are not supposed to move the slides against each other in a sliding manner. Are you able to pull the
     slides apart? You will not be able to do it as both the slides very strongly stick to each other.</li></ol>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10200013"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">Here we have a thin film of water between the two slides. The adhesive force acting between the glass and
water is responsible for sticking up of the slides. Greater the surface area larger will be this force. It is
the adhesive force that creates surface tension. We can also understand the strong sticking up of the
slides by means of the formula for surface tension. The water trapped between the slides has a lower
pressure as compared to the atmospheric pressure. The outside pressure of the air tries to push the
slides towards each other and so we have to apply more force trying the separate the slides from each
other.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10300013"></a>Do and think a little more</h3>
<!--l. 16--><p class="noindent">Often, in the early morning we see very minute water or dew drops being spread on the leaves of some trees, On
slightly raising or lowering these leaves, these drops slide over the leaves without breaking or spreading. This
is because the cohesive force between the water molecules is greater than the adhesive force acting
between the molecules of water and leaves and so the drops do not disintegrate or get spread over the
leaves.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10600014"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">We know that there is strength in unity. For example, if you ask your friend to break a piece of stick into two pieces
he will readily do it. Next, give him four-five stick tied together and ask him to break them; surely, he will not be
able to do it. We will see just the reverse of this happening in this game. You will see that while a single nail is able
to deflate the balloon, a multitude of nails will not be able to deflate it. Does it mean that there is no strength in
unity?
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10700014"></a>Required Material</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Balloons, a large number of nails, a large and a small rectangular wooden seat
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10800014"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-108002x1">First stick a large number of small nails on the large rectangular seat. The nail should be very close
     together and their heads should be visible with their piercing ends being fixed on the seat. In this way
     you will be creating, so to say, a bed of nails.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-108004x2">Stick only a single nail on the smaller seat in the same manner.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-108006x3">Next inflate a balloon and place it on the nail stick to the smaller seat. Press the balloon gently. Does
     the balloon get deflated? Usually, it will be deflated.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-108008x4">Now inflate another balloon and place it this time on the bed of nails. Press the balloon gently. Does
     the balloon get deflated or not? No, this time the balloon is not deflated. Even if you press the balloon
     with force it does not get deflated. Think why is this so happening?</li></ol>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-10900014"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">In the first case when we press the balloon by placing it over a single nail, the balloon exerts a force on the nail. In
this case, this force is exerted on a single nail only. The nail by way of reaction, also exerts an equal and opposite
force on the balloon. This force is enough to puncture the balloon which, therefore gets deflated. In the second case,
when the balloon is in contact with a large number of nails, the force exerted by the balloon (which is
almost equal to the force in the first case) gets distributed amongst multiple nails. This means that, in
this case, a very small force is exerted by the balloon on the individual nails. The force of reaction
exerted by the individual nails on the balloon gets reduced proportionately and attains such a value that
is not enough to puncture the balloon. We can also understand this as follows. The force acting on
the balloon gets distributed over a large surface area and so the balloon does not get punctured. We
can understand from this experiment that when a force is applied on a small surface area, then the
pressure on that area is more and when the same force is applied on a bigger surface area the pressure
decreases.
<!--l. 16--></p><p class="indent">   In this experiment, if we apply a force equivalent to 10 kg on the balloon, than for the case when there is a single
nail, the entire force gets exerted on it. The nail also exerts the full, 10 kg equivalent force, on a very small area of
the balloon and punctures it of leading to the deflating of the balloon. However in case there are, say 50
nails then a force equivalent to 10/50 kg or 200 gm is exerted on the individual nails. These nails,
in turn, each exert on the balloon a 200 gm equivalent force. This force is not able to puncture the
balloon.
                                                                                          
                                                                                          
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-11000014"></a>Do and Think a little more</h3>
<!--l. 18--><p class="noindent">Repeat this experiment by sticking instead of one, two, three and even more nails on the small seat and find out how
many nails would be needed so that the balloon does not get deflated.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-11400015"></a>Objective</h3>
<!--l. 2--><p class="noindent">To demonstrate that heat is produced in air, hot air goes up and cooler air from surrounding flows towards this
making convection currents.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-11500015"></a>Equipment</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">A kerosene lamp, an extra glass cover of the kerocen lamp.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-11600015"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">When kerosene lamp is lighted, the surrounding air in the glass cover gets heated. The density of hot air is less than
the cold air. The gases produced during burning are also hot. All this hot gaseous mass rises and goes out of the
lamp through the glass cover. There are holes made in the part below the glass cover. Fresh air from
outside enters the lamp through these holes, get heated and goes up. Thus a convection current is set
up.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   The present demo makes arrangement where one can visually see the flow paths of gaseous mass when a lamp is
lighted.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-11700015"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">Take a kerosene lamp with some kerosene and wick in place. Take a cardboard box, like a shoe box. Place it in a way
that the opening side is vertical and is towards you. Cut two holes on the top cover of the box so that the glass
covers of the lamp can be fitted in these. Put a lamp inside the box below one of the holes. One of the glass covers
should go through the hole and fit with the lamp. Let me call this Cover-1. Put another glass cover in the other
hole. I will call it cover-2. Close any gap remaining between the glass covers and the cardboard top
cover.
<!--l. 11--></p><p class="indent">   Light the lamp, put it in place and close the box. Light an incense stick. Where is the smoke going? It goes up.
That is the natural tendency of smoke. Put the stick near the glass cover-1. The smoke goes up. Now put the stick
near the glass cover-2. Here is the real climax. The smoke is pulled down into the glass cover-2 and it come out from
the glass cover-1.
<!--l. 13--></p><p class="indent">   Why is the smoke dragged into the glass cover against its natural tendency to go up? This is because the burning
wick of the lamp produced hot gases which rose up and went out through the glass cover-1. To fill the void, air
should rush in. The only path available for fresh air is through the glass cover-2. So convection current is set
up where air from outside goes into cover-2, goes into the box, and then to the wick area. The hot
gases formed there go up and come out of cover-1. When the stick is placed near the cover-2, smoke is
dragged by the air current that already exist there. The flow path of smoke is just the path of convection
current.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">three plates, four similar candles, three drinking glasses of same size.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-13300017"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">The experiment described in the first part is very famous and is used by many teachers and students to show that
there is 21% oxygen in air. In this demo experiment I will show that the real physics of rising water is very
different.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-13400017"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Put a candle vertically in a plate. Light the candle. Put some water in the plate so that a small lower portion of
the candle is in water. The candle keeps on burning. Cover the burning candle by an inverted glass.
The candle goes off and water rises in the glass. How much water will rise in glass depends on the
thickness of the candle and how much time you allowed the candle to burn before you covered it.
Use a candle and cover it quickly after burning. As the candle goes off, very small amount of water
rises in the glass. It could be hardly 5% of the volume of the glass. Leave this set up as it is and take
another plate, put a similar candle, pour water, light the candle and wait for some time. If a fan is
running nearby put it off. Now cover it with a glass of the same size. This time water rise will be much
more.
<!--l. 8--></p><p class="indent">   Now take the third plate and put two candles in it. Pour water in the plate and light all the candles. Wait for
some time and then cover both by a glass of the same size as used in the previous trials. This time the water rise will
be very high, may be 40-50%.
<!--l. 10--></p><p class="indent">   What is the Physics of this rising water? When candle burns the air surrounding the flame becomes hot. The
flame itself is very hot gases. The pressure of this surrounding air is the same as the atmospheric pressure as all air
is connected. As pressure remains the same and the temperature rises the density goes down from the gas law
<span class="cmmi-10">PV </span><span class="cmr-10">= </span><span class="cmmi-10">nRT</span>. For a given volume <span class="cmmi-10">n </span>will decrease if <span class="cmmi-10">T </span>increases. When you cover the candle(s) you trap this less dense
air. As the oxygen is consumed and the candle goes off, the air (gases in fact) inside the glass cools down. As the
number of moles n is now fixed, decreasing the temperature will decrease the pressure and this will suck water
in the glass. In equilibrium the temperature in the glass will be the same as the room temperature,
the pressure will be <span class="cmmi-10">P </span><span class="cmr-10">= </span><span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub> <span class="cmsy-10">- </span><span class="cmmi-10">h&#961;g</span>, where <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub> is the atmospheric pressure and <span class="cmmi-10">h </span>is the height water
rises.
<!--l. 12--></p><p class="indent">   If you cover the candle just after the burning, the air trapped is not that hot. The density is thus not much
lowered and hence on candle going off the water rise is not much. On the other hand if you burn two content in air.
In fact for each oxygen molecule consumed, you produce a molecule of <span class="cmr-10">CO</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> among other products. Also the
solubility of <span class="cmr-10">CO</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub> is lower than that of <span class="cmr-10">O</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">2</span></sub>. So there is no question of decrease in pressure inside due to consuming
oxygen.
<!--l. 14--></p><p class="indent">   There is another factor that contributes in rising water in the glass. At higher temperature the saturation vapour
pressure of water is also high. As the air in the inverted glass is in contact with water, it will contain
saturated vapour. When the candle goes off and the temperature falls, saturation vapour pressure also
decreases and some of the vapour condenses. This also decreases pressure inside and helps in rise of
water.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">A heater, a conical flask with tightly fitting stopper
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-14100018"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">Boiling point of a liquid depends on the pressure above its surface. Lower the pressure, lower is the boiling point.
Thus you can boil water at a temperature much below the normal boiling point if the pressure above its surface is
reduced. In this demo we do precisely this. The demo is very interesting and catches attention of everyone
around.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-14200018"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Take some water in a conical flask (say half the volume). The flask should be of good quality. I have done the
experiment with Borosil flasks. Put the flask on a heater. Let it boil for about 5 minutes. Put off the heater. Now
carefully hold the flask from its neck by using a handkerchief and put stopper in it as early as possible. The water
stops boiling because it is no more on heater. Put some cold water on the flask, especially on the empty portion. The
water starts boiling in the flask. Wait for about a minute and the boiling stops. Again put cold water on
the flask. The water in the flask again starts boiling. You can repeat this several times. Why does
water boil when cold water is poured on the flask? When initially you boiled the water on the heater,
there was no stopper. Vapour generated during boiling replaced air and there was largely only the
vapour above the water in the flask. At this stage you fitted the stopper tightly which closed any
possibility of air entering the flask. The water has cooled down a little by this time and there is no
question of boiling. Even at the boiling temperature it boils only when heat is supplied to it which is
used in conversion of water to vapour. You poured cold water at this stage. The vapour condensed to
water as a result of cooling due to cold water. This greatly reduced the pressure inside the flask. At
such a low pressure, the boiling point of water is quite low and the existing temperature of water is
much larger than this new boiling point. Thus water starts boiling and coverts to vapour. The pressure
inside again increases due to this vapour. Correspondingly the boiling point increases and the water
stops boiling at a certain stage. Then you put cold water again. The same process repeats and water
boils.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-14300018"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">Please take care of accidents. The heater must be a good quality and you should check that there is no current in
the body when the heater is put on. Handling hot water should be done with extreme care. Hold the flask from the
neck only using sufficiently thick layer of cloth (handkerchief). While putting the stopper, the flask should rest on a
firm surface. Though you put cold water several times, the lower portion of the flask remains hot. Don’t try to hold
it from there without checking. Once the demo is over you may like to open the stopper. This seems to be the most
difficult task. Since the pressure inside remains much lower than the atmospheric pressure, it does
not come out easily. Heat the flask a little and then take it out if it does not come with mechanical
effort.

<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">To show that air exerts pressure, science textbooks at lower classes describe an activity where a drinking glass is
filled to the brim with water, is covered by a cardboard and then inverted. The demo consists of seeing that the
cardboard does not fall. The explanation is that air exerts force on the cardboard from below and this force is more
than that exerted on the cardboard by the water. So the card is pushed up and does not fall. The present demo is a
slight modification in this famous activity wherein the water is not filled up to the brim and then it becomes a demo
for Boyle’s law.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-15000019"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">Take a drinking glass and fill it up to about half with water. Put a plane cover on the glass. You can use a
cardboard, or a plastic cover or any other plane cover. Hold the cover by pressing from top with one hand and invert
the glass. Gently remove the hand from the cover. The cover does not fall and holds the water in the
glass.
<!--l. 11--></p><p class="indent">   The upper portion of the glass contains air and hence presses the water down. The force on the cover due to
water is <span class="cmmi-10">A</span><span class="cmr-10">(</span><span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> <span class="cmr-10">+ </span><span class="cmmi-10">h&#961;g</span><span class="cmr-10">)</span>; where <span class="cmmi-10">A </span>is the area in the upper portion of the glass, <span class="cmmi-10">h </span>is the height of the water column and
<span class="cmmi-10">&#961; </span>is the density of water. From the bottom the force is <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub><span class="cmmi-10">A</span>; where <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub> is the atmospheric pressure. The fact that the
card does not fall tells that <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> <span class="cmmi-10">&lt; P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>. How did <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">1</span></sub> become smaller than <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>? When you covered the glass, the air
trapped was at the atmospheric pressure <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>. It is the same air that is now in the upper portion (provided you have
not allowed air to leak out or leak in during inverting the glass) the volume of air should be the equal to (volume of
glass)- (volume of water). If both remain the same, the volume of water should remain the same. The
temperature is anyway the same. So from <span class="cmmi-10">PV </span><span class="cmr-10">= </span><span class="cmmi-10">nRT</span>, the pressure should remain the same, that is
<span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>.
<!--l. 13--></p><p class="indent">   But it does not remain <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>. It becomes less than <span class="cmmi-10">P</span><sub><span class="cmr-7">0</span></sub>. In fact the cover goes slightly down when the glass is
inverted. If it is a cardboard cover, it may buldge at the centre. If it is plastic cover, it goes slightly down and there
is a water slice between the glass and the cover. This you can verify by slightly tapping the cover horizontally. You
will find that the cover moves quite smoothly. This shows that it is not rubbing the glass surface. Here surface
tension also has to play a role.
<!--l. 15--></p><p class="indent">   As the cover goes slightly down, the volume of air in the upper portion increases. This decreases in pressure
according to the Boyle’s law and the water column stays in equilibrium.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-15100019"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 17--><p class="noindent">Sometimes few drops of water may go out while inverting. If air has not gotten into the glass in this period, the
volume of air will increase and hence the pressure will decrease. Sometimes few bubbles of air also gets in. This
happens when somewhat larger mass of water comes out during inversion. In such a case right amount of air will go
in which can maintain the cardboard in equilibrium. .

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Thermal conductivity of a material is one of the key factors which decides how much heat will pass through it if the

flow. In the informal lab, the students can compare the thermal conductivities of different materials in a simple
manner.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-15800020"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent">Suppose we wish to compare the conductivities of copper and steel. You have to procure a rod of each material. It
could be say 10 cm long and 0.2 cm in radius. The dimensions are not crucial but two rods should be similar except
for the material. The cross section also need not be circular. Take three metal cans A, B and C. The cans
A and C should be identical, B may or may not be identical to others. Drill a hole in A and C and
two holes in B. The holes should be such that the rods may be fitted in them and they should be
at the same height from the bottom. Fit the copper rod between the cans A and B, and the steel
rod between B and C. Close any gap between the rod and the can at the hole by an adhesive, say
araldite.
<!--l. 11--></p><p class="indent">   Fill some water in the cans. The amount of water in A and C should be the same. The ends of the rods should be
immersed in water. Put thermometers in A, B and C. Put immersion heater in the can B and switch it on. Be
careful, if the heater is faulty it can send electrical current in water and can. Do not touch anything when the switch
it on.
<!--l. 13--></p><p class="indent">   In few minutes water in can B will start boiling. Read temperatures in all the cans. Steel is poorer conductor of
heat as compared to copper. The temperature rise in A should be more than in B. By comparing the temperature
rise in the two cans in a given time interval, you can have an estimate of the ratio of the thermal conductivities of
the two materials.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-15900020"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">The equation for heat flow given above may not be usable in the conditions described. There are losses to the
atmosphere at every stage. That is why I insist on having all other conditions identical except the
materials of the rod. If the student wishes he/she may modify the procedure to get more accurate
results.

   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-16700021"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">Air in our surrounding contains water vapour. In general the amount of vapour in a given volume of air
is less than that required to saturate it. That is why wet cloths dry, water kept in a shallow plate
evaporates and so on. The amount of vapour needed to saturate the air depends on temperature. At higher
temperature, larger amount of vapour in needed to saturate the air than that needed at lower temperature. If
the temperature of the air in your room is decreased sufficiently, the existing amount of vapour will
become sufficient to saturate it. If the air is further cooled the existing amount of vapour will become
more than that needed to saturate the air and then some vapour will condense to liquid water. This
is what happens during the winter nights in open fields. The water that appears on grass or other
objects is called Dew. The temperature at which the existing vapour in air will saturate it is called the
“Dew point”. Evidently, the dew point will vary with place and time. During rainy season there is
lot of vapour in air and the due point will be high. During dry seasons the dew point will be low as
there will be only small amount of vapour present in air. The amount of vapour present in air is often
represented by the pressure exterted by the vapour molecules. This is known as vapour pressure. If the air is
saturated with the vapour the vapour pressure is called saturation vapour pressure. The saturation
vapour pressure at different temperatures have been measured carefully and tables are available to give
these data. If you know the dew point, you can immediately calculate the relative humidity by the
relation:
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   Relative humidity = (saturation vapour pressure at dew point)/( saturation vapour pressure at the existing air
temperature).
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-16800021"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent">Put two steel glasses side by side. Keep cold water, taken from a refrigerator or water cooler in a bottle or a jug. It
should be cold enough so that you can see large water drops on the outer surface of the bottle. Fill one of the steel
gasses with normal tap water up to say one-fourth of its height. Put the thermometer in the water.
Ask some one to keep looking at the outer surfaces of the two glasses. Pour a small amount of cold
water in the water, stir with the thermometer and ask the person looking at the glasses if she/he can
see a difference in the shining of the two glasses. If not pour some more cold water and repeat the
observation. When the difference in shining is observed read the thermometer. This is the dew point. Steel
is a good conductor of heat and the thickness of the wall is also quite small. So the temperature of
the outer surface of the glass, up to the height of the water, quickly becomes the same as that of the
water inside. The air in contact with this part of the steel surface also cools down and attains this
temperature. When the temperature falls to the dew point and goes slightly below it, vapour in this
part of the air starts condensing and small droplets collect on the glass surface. By comparing the
two glasses kept side by side, you can easily make out when this condensation has just started. So
the dew point can be easily obtained. Using the saturation vapour pressure table, find the relative
humidity.

<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">The dew point can be measured very accurately using this procedure. If your thermometer reads up to half a degree
and you do the experiment carefully, you can get the dew point within the accuracy of half degree. Make sure that
your initial water in cold enough. The test is that water drops are very clearly seen on the outer surface of the vessel
containing the cold water. You can first do a rough experiment to get an estimate of the dew point and
then do a fine experiment by varyuing the mixture temperature in that vicinity to get more accurate
value.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">To study total internal reflection
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-17500022"></a>Equipment</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">A dettol bottle, some common salt, a laser torch Introduction: When light goes from a denser medium to a rarer
medium, and the angle of incidence is larger than a critical value, called critical angle, whole of the light will get
reflected at the surface. If the angle of incidence is smaller than the critical angle, part of the light is reflected and
part of it is refracted. In this inexpensive demo we show the light paths as the medium changes and hence all
phenomena on refraction can be visually seen. It is very simple and has been widely appreciated wherever we have
shown it.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-17600022"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent">Take a dettol bottle and fill water in it up to say three fourths of its height. Put some common salt in it. Tighten the
cap. Put on a laser torch and send light from outside into the water obliquely. The front end of the torch should be
in contact with the thinner side of the bottle at a height covered by water, and the incline of the torch should be
adjusted by tilting the torch with your hand. Adjust the orientation so that the light goes parallel to the flat faces of
the bottle, but at an angle to the surface of the water. You should be able to see the path of the laser beam in
the water. If it is not clearly visible, invert the bottle for a second. This will bring the salt sitting at
the bottom in the whole water and make the path visible. Slowly change the orientation of the laser
torch and you very clearly see the total internal reflection. If you make the torch closer to vertical,
thus decreasing the angle of incidence, the reflected beam will loose its intensity. A spot will form on
the opposite wall of the bottle above the water surface. This tells that a part of the beam is getting
transmitted. Now you put smoke of an incense stick into the bottle. It will collect above the water
surface. Now when you send laser beam and if it gets transmitted to air side the transmitted beam will
also be clearly seen, though it will be hazy. So for angles less than the critical angle you see both
reflected and transmitted beams, and for angles larger than the critical angle, only reflected beam is
observed.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-17700022"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 12--><p class="noindent">Dettol bottle suites this demo because the walls are flat. This demo can be extended to informal lab, by encouraging
students to adjust the torch for grazing angle refraction and measuring the inclination angle from vertical which is
also the normal to the surface. This angle is the critical angle.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Two laser torches, a long trough (say <span class="cmr-10">20 cm</span>), a convex lens of focal length about <span class="cmr-10">10 cm</span> or less.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-18400023"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent">The focal length of a lens depends on the curvatures of the two lens surfaces and on the refractive indices
of the lens and the surrounding medium. Thus if the lens is kept inside water, its focal length will
increase.
<!--l. 8--></p><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-18500023"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 8--><p class="noindent">Take a convex lens and measure its focal length (roughly) by imaging distant objects on a wall or a paper. Put two
laser torches parallel to each other on a base and fix them. Connect to power. Take care you do not stare into the
laser. You get parallel beams of red light. Put water in a long trough and put a few drops of soap solution in it.
Position the laser base so that light goes in water along the length of the trough. The two beams will be clearly
visible from the top. If it is not so, you have most likely put more soap solution than required. Adjust it again. The
beams are quite narrow and you can treat each of these as a ray of light. Put a convex lens inside the water so
that the axis is parallel to the beams of light. The two beams will bend towards each other and will
intersect. Measure the distance of the lens from the place where the two beams intersect. This is the
focal length of the lens in water. Check that the focal length in water is much larger than that in
air.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-18600023"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 11--><p class="noindent">The basic theme is to make the rays visible in water. Once that tool is there you can design many experiments and
perform them. Supervise students and repeatedly remind them that laser light should not fall directly into
eyes.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-18700023"></a>When to do</h3>
<!--l. 13--><p class="noindent">Students may be introduced to this activity generally after they have done refraction at spherical surfaces (Class
11-12). However class 10 students may also do it and learn from experiments that putting a lens in water increases
its focal length. They learn the theory later.

<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">While sitting in a hair dresser saloon we see in the mirror our many images. This looks very pleasing to us. It
appears as though all the images are situated in a long tunnel. But this becomes possible only when a mirror is fixed
just at our back which is parallel to the front mirror. We shall explain this with the help of an interesting
experiment.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-19200024"></a>Required material</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Two polished and properly framed mirrors, cello tape, scissor, candle.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-19300024"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">
     </p><ol class="enumerate1">
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-193002x1">Place both the mirrors side by side and fix the junction where they meet with a cello tape. Now you
     will be able to open and close the mirrors like a book.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-193004x2">Place both the mirrors at a small angle apart in the upright position on the floor.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-193006x3">Place a lighted candle in the space between the two mirrors. You will observe many images of the
     candle which makes a very beautiful scene.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-193008x4">Now by gradually decreasing the angle between the mirrors observe the images being formed. You will
     now observe more and more images of the candle being formed.
     </li>
     <li class="enumerate" id="x1-193010x5">Similarly, if the angle between the mirrors is increased the number of images decreases and when this
     angle is <span class="cmr-10">180</span> <span class="cmr-10">°</span>, only one image will be visible.</li></ol>
<!--l. 14--><p class="noindent">
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-19400024"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 15--><p class="noindent">When the angle between the two mirrors is 180 they together act like a single mirror so that only one image is
visible. As the angle between the mirrors gradually decreased, not only the candle but the mirrors themselves get
imaged in one another. That is why when the angle between the mirrors is decreased one observe
image within image, and image within that image, and so on. In this way one observes a lot many
images. if the angle between the mirrors is finally decreased to zero, Infinite images are expected to be
formed. The salutation is similar to our sitting at the hair dresser saloon where we see multitude of our
images.

   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-20900026"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent">When a magnet falls through a conducting tube, changing magnetic field is produced in the volume of the tube. Not
only field is different at different places in the tube, it is also changing with time at any given place. Taking the long
axis of the tube along the z-axis, the field change is largely in z- direction. A field changing in z-direction
produces electric field in the circumferential direction. The electric field lines are circular, coaxial with the
z-axis. This field drives an electric current in the circumferential direction. The energy is lost in joule
heating and this comes from the mechanical energy of the falling magnet. The magnet thus experiences
an upward force slowing it down. The magnet takes an extraordinarily long time to fall through the
tube.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-21000026"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Take a strong, short, cylindrical magnet. These are made of certain magnetic alloys like Niobium-iron-boron alloy.
The size should be such that it can easily go through the aluminum tube you will be using. Take a similar looking
piece of unmagnetized iron such as a nut or bolt and two or three more small objects made of different
materials.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   Keep the aluminum tube vertical and hold it in one hand. Drop different objects in the tube at the upper end
and ask the students to estimate the time it takes for them to emerge from the other end. If your tube is 1 m long, it
will take only a fraction of second and estimates will be difficult to make. But they will have in mind that it is much
less than a second.
<!--l. 9--></p><p class="indent">   Now drop the magnet in the same way. Students will be amazed to see that the magnet is not coming out. It
takes very long time as compared to other objects. The time depends on the wall thickness of the tube and the
strength of the tube. For the tube that I use it is about 7 seconds, more than 25 times longer than the other
objects.

<!--l. 10--><p class="noindent">It is instructive to understand where does the upward force come on the falling magnet. To the advanced students
you can discuss the direction of current in the tube. The current goes in circular paths on the tube. Above
the magnet it is in one sense and below the magnet it is in the other sense. Suppose the north pole
of the magnet is up and the south pole is down. The current above the magnet is anticlockwise as
seen from the top and that below is clockwise. The axial component of the magnetic field is outward
in the portion above the magnet and inward below the magnet. Use to check that in both cases the
force is upwards. Is it possible to design this experiment for balancing magnet in air? The answer is
no!

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-21600027"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">There are many experiments demonstrating Faraday’s law of Electromagnetic Induction. whenever a conductor is
placed in a varying magnetic foield or it moves under a magnetic field, emf is induced. If there are conducting paths
available, currents start in the conductor which we call Eddy current. This experiment is one nice way to
demonstrate eddy currents.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-21700027"></a>Required Material</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">An aluminum disc with an attachment to fit in the spindle of a tape motor, a magnet, a tape motor, an adaptor and
a power source.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-21800027"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">Mount the disc on the spindle of the tape motor. Connect the motor to the power source through an adaptor. Switch
on the power so that the tape motor along with the connected aluminum disc starts rotating. Soon it will pick up a
good speed. Now bring a magnet very close to the rotating disc. A pole should face the disc surface.
The disc gradually slows down to almost a halt. Take the magnet a bit away. The disc again picks up
speed.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-21900027"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">The free electrons of the disc also move with the disc. When the magnet is kept near the rotating aluminum disc, the
free electrons of the aluminum disc below the magnet experience magnetic force causing a motional emf in the
conductor. This produces eddy currents in the disc. Energy is consumed in these currents putting more load on the
motor. So the disc slows down.

to connect the circuits. What about using atta (ground wheat) dove in the place of wires? You can
easily change the shape of the dove and hence study the electrical properties of such connecting lines
effectively. To make this dove conducting, we suggest putting salt solution while preparing the dove
.

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">Magnets attract iron clips, pins, nails etc very strongly. This is because iron is a ferromagnetic material. There are
certain materials in which large number of atoms/molecules are magnetically ordered making domains. These are
ferromagnetically/antiferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials.
<!--l. 7--></p><p class="indent">   In large number of materials, magnetic ordering is absent. In some materials, the individual atom/molecule/ions
does not have a magnetic moment. Such materials are diamagnetic and are weakly repelled by magnets. In another
class of materials, the individual entity has magnetic moment but they do not much interact with each other and do
not form domains, such materials are called paramagnetic.
<!--l. 9--></p><p class="indent">   While ferromagnetic materials ate strongly attracted to a magnet, the attraction or repulsion of a paramagnetic
or a diamagnetic material is quite weak. That is why we do not see any effect of magnet on aluminum, copper, glass,
plastic etc, In this experiment you will experience these forces and will classify some objects whether they are
paramagnetic or diamagnetic.

   <h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-23600030"></a>Introduction</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent">Magnets have been fascinating objects for people of all age groups. Like poles repel and unlike poles attract. That is
the first lesson that we learn about magnets. But with combination of magnets, you can create regions where
another test magnet can stay in stable equilibrium. Stable in the sense that if you displace the test magnet a little in
any direction, the magnet comes back to its original position. Here is one attractive toy using a special configuration
of the fields.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-23700030"></a>Required Material</h3>
<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent">A flat base, a pencil, three wooden cylindrical rods of length somewhat less than the length of the pencil, four ring
magnets with diameter slightly more than that of the pencil.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-23800030"></a>Procedure</h3>
<!--l. 7--><p class="noindent">Drill three holes in the flat base so that screws can be fixed in them. Drill small holes in the bottoms of the rods.
Now fix the rods on the base using screws. Now take three magnets and keep similar poles upwards. Fix the magnets
on the top of the rods using quick fix. Fix a ring magnet on the pencil again with the help of quick fix at the same
distance from the tip. When placed on the tip, the four magnets should be at the same height and all the upward
poles should be of same nature. Fix a two-blade wane on the top of the pencil. Now the apparatus is
ready. Place the pencil vertically with its tip on the flat base, right at the center between the three
rods. And it stands comfortably. Give a slight sideways push to the wanes to rotate it. The pencil will
keep rotating for a long time. You can decorate the pencil so that when it rotates it shows interesting
patterns.
   </p><h3 class="likesectionHead"><a id="x1-23900030"></a>Discussion</h3>
<!--l. 9--><p class="noindent">The three magnets placed at the same horizontal level produce a magnetic field pattern which gives zero field at the
center. Thus the magnet does not feel any magnetic force here. But that is as simple as placing the
pencil on the tip without any magnet. Important point is that around the center, as you go slightly
out of the plane the field increases symmetrically at all sides. The direction is such that it pushes
the magnet on the pencil back towards the center. That provides stability and resists its toppling
down.
